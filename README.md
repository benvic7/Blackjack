# Blackjack
Authors: Ben Vicinelli and John Delucia
Language: C#

This program develops an interactive (backend only) blackjack game.

We leveraged object-oriented programming techniques to organize and maintain our code.
We used dictionaries to store and implement the cards and objects for the players and deck.
We implemented various algorithms to determine dealer decisions.
Up to two players can play against the house, betting in increments of $25.
